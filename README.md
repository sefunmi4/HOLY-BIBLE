# HOLY-BIBLE
Book experience of the HOLY BIBLE

Comments will quote passages from the HOLY BIBLE (NIV version).
Code will translate those passages into interactive and experience-based stories & games.

## Why? 
Yuval Noah Harari mentioned that what makes people special is the stories we tell and the different ways we do it. 
Like scribes writing on paper, code is a new form of storytelling that allows us to interact with and experience the stories we choose to tell. 

I want to know what it is like to be a scribe, practice coding, and mainly do some bible studies.

I also think it's important to write code as a new form of record-keeping.
