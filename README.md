# HOLY-BIBLE

A project exploring a **full‑stack book experience** for the Holy Bible. The goal is to use code and notebooks to create interactive retellings of biblical passages.

Comments quote passages from the HOLY BIBLE (NIV version) and code translates those passages into interactive stories and small games.

## Why?
Yuval Noah Harari mentioned that what makes people special is the stories we tell and the different ways we do it. Like scribes writing on paper, code is a new form of storytelling that allows us to interact with and experience the stories we choose to tell.

I want to know what it is like to be a scribe, practice coding and bible studies, and use code as a new form of record‑keeping.
