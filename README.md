# HOLY-BIBLE
Book experience of the HOLY BIBLE

Comments will quote passages of the HOLY BIBLE (NIV version).
Code will translate those passages into interactive and experince based storys & games.

## Why? 
Yuval Noah Harari mentioned that what markes people special is the storyies we tell and the different ways we do it. 
Like scribes in writing on paper, code is a new form of story telling that allows us to interact and experince the stories we wish to tell. 

I want to know what it like to be a scribe, practice coding, and most importantly for me do some bible studies.

If you are intreseted in any aspect of this project feel free to message me on gihtub, send feature request, bug issue, or clone repo and send pull request.
